{"prompt":"What is the Deutschland-Ticket?","completion":"The Deutschland-Ticket is the successor to the 9-Euro-Ticket, which was offered as a special measure in the summer months of 2022. The 9-Euro-Ticket was introduced by the German government to relieve the burden on people due to the sharp rise in costs for electricity, food, heating and mobility.\n\nIt was a great success and also helped the environment by encouraging greater use of public transport.
